### Welcome!
You'll find the R code behind many of my football :football: data visualisations right here. <br> <br>
If you're into football analytics and getting started with coding, be sure to check out some of my scripts that explain the work I post on Twitter. I'll be aiming to keep this repository updated as much as possible and I hope it can play some small part in you improving our own coding skills. :blush: <br> <br>
